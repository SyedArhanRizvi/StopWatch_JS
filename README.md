- Minimal and clean UI design
- Accurate time tracking in hours, minutes, and seconds
- Fully responsive layout

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to help students and beginners:
- Understand JavaScript concepts like `setInterval` and DOM manipulation.
- Build confidence in creating functional web applications.
- Gain hands-on experience in structuring HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Live Demo

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.**

That's it! You can now explore the stopwatch and modify the code to learn more.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** To structure the application.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and functionality.

## File Structure

```
stopwatch/
│
├── index.html   # Main HTML file
├── style.css    # CSS file for styling
└── script.js    # JavaScript file for functionality
```

## How It Works

1. **Start Button:** Starts the stopwatch by calling the `setInterval` method.
2. **Stop Button:** Stops the stopwatch by clearing the interval.
3. **Reset Button:** Resets the timer to zero and stops the interval.
